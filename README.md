# MinimalistFontViewer

An Android viewer for TTF and OTF fonts that lets designers preview fonts with minimal distractions. This project is currently WIP and **not yet functional**.

Features to be implemented:
* Load fonts from individual font files, ZIP files or folders
* Inspect font properties (full name, family, type, author, license, etc.)
* Group fonts into collections
* Wrap collections into ZIP files for sharing (via email, Google Drive, etc.)
* Background and foreground customization
* Preview text customization
* Fullscreen view
* Font caching for fast and efficient rendering
* Preview font on Material design action bar

Note: This project is currently written in Java, but a migration to Kotlin is planned.
